Interviews are one of the most effective ways for gathering information for case studies. They provide direct insights from customers about their experiences with your product or solution.

## Understand your role

I highly recommend you, as the case study writer, participate in the interview process, even if only as an observer. Firsthand involvement helps you understand subtle nuances, capture tone and context, and structure the story more effectively. If you are conducting the interview, you’ll be able to steer the conversation to gather all the critical information you need.

If you cannot attend the interview, make sure to request comprehensive notes, the meeting recording, or any shared materials from the interviewer.

## Pre-interview preparation

Proper preparation sets the stage for a productive interview. Here's how to ensure you're ready:

- Internal alignment
    - Determine who will lead the questioning.
    - Agree on key information you need to gather.
    - Collect background information about the customer from other team members like Product Managers and Customer Support Engineers.
- Logistics
    - If you are the organiser, find a time slot that works for all participants. Allow enough time for detailed discussion, which usually lasts 45-60 minutes.
    - Politely ask the customer if you can record the conversation. Explain the recording is for internal use only and have a backup plan for note-taking if it is declined.
    - Prepare your question lists in advance and send them to the customer if requested.

## Sample questions

I list some sample questions for different sections of a typical case study. Use these as a starting point and keep these key principles in mind:

- Adjust questions based on your research and specific needs
- Skip questions where you already have reliable information
- Remain flexible with question order. Customers often address multiple topics in a single response
- Use different phrasings to get complete information
- Ask for specific examples or more details when interesting points arise
- Pay attention to the customer's language and terminology. They can help make your case study more authentic
- Always probe for specific numbers, metrics, or percentages when discussing results
- Record exact quotes when customers express particularly compelling points

    - Review recording or notes immediately while the details are still fresh
    - Identify any gaps in information that need follow-up
    - Create a list of additional follow-up questions
2. **Follow up**
    - Send a thank-you email to all participants
    - Request any additional information needed

3. **Writing**
    - Transcribe important quotes
    - Organise information by case study sections
    - Note specific metrics and results
    - Document any technical details that need verification
4. **Verification**
    - Confirm technical details with your engineering team
    - Verify metrics and numbers with the customer
    - Get approval for any direct quotes you plan to use

Each interview is unique. You should adapt your approach based on the customer, their story, and the information you need to gather.
