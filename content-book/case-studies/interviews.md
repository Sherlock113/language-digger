Interviews are one of the most effective ways for gathering information for case studies. They provide direct insights from customers about their experiences with your product or solution.

## Understand your role

I highly recommend you, as the case study writer, participate in the interview process, even if only as an observer. Firsthand involvement helps you understand subtle nuances, capture tone and context, and structure the story more effectively. If you are conducting the interview, you’ll be able to steer the conversation to gather all the critical information you need.

If you cannot attend the interview, make sure to request comprehensive notes, the meeting recording, or any shared materials from the interviewer.

## Pre-interview preparation

Proper preparation sets the stage for a productive interview. Here’s how to ensure you’re ready:

- Internal alignment
    - Determine who will lead the questioning.
    - Agree on key information you need to gather.
    - Collect background information about the customer from other team members like Product Managers and Customer Support Engineers.
- Logistics
    - Find a time slot that works for all participants (If you are the organizer). Allow enough time for detailed discussion (usually 45-60 minutes).
    - Politely ask the customer if you can record the conversation. Explain the recording is for internal use only and have a backup plan for note-taking if it is declined.
    - Prepare your question lists in advance and send them to the customer if requested.
