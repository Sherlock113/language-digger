A case study follows a straightforward structure built around the classic storytelling arc: challenge, solution, and result. This section provides examples of common structural elements in effective case studies.

## Sample components

While the following structure serves as a template, it is **not a strict formula**. Adapt it to tell your customer story in the most compelling way. Depending on the specifics of the case, some sections might require more focus, while others can be streamlined or omitted.

Keep in mind that the titles I use here are for **explanatory purposes only**. Feel free to choose titles that best suit your narrative and resonate with your audience.

### Introduction/Background

Set the stage by introducing your customer and their context. If possible, focus on information that connects to the problem your product is addressing.

Example elements:

- A brief company overview (e.g., size, industry, mission)
- Description of the product or service they create or sell
- Context that frames the challenge they were facing (no details here)

Things to notice:

- Always get your customer's approval for this section. Let them decide how they want to be introduced.
- Consider alternative layouts. Some websites present basic information (industry, company size, adopted features) in sidebars rather than the main narrative.
- Avoid including technical details here.

### Challenge/Problem

Paint a clear picture of the customer’s situation before adopting your solution. Highlight their pain points and sets the stage for why they needed your help.

Example elements:

- Their previous workflow or approach that fell short (especially your competitors)
- Specific pain points, bottlenecks, or inefficiencies
- Quantified impacts where possible (e.g., time lost, costs incurred, missed opportunities)
- The urgency or importance of solving the problem

### Decision process

Explain how the customer discovered and evaluated your product as a solution. Emphasise what stood out about your offering and why they chose it over others.

Example elements:

- Key requirements the customer sought in a solution
- Features or capabilities that tipped the decision in your favour
- Benchmarks comparing alternative solutions (if results were favourable)
- Quotes from the customer detailing their evaluation process

### Implementation/Migration

Summarise how the customer implemented or transitioned to your product. Focus on the story of adoption rather than technical minutiae.

Example elements:

- Implementation timeline or key milestones
- Initial setup or onboarding experience
- Collaboration between your team and the customer
- Challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- Diagrams (e.g., architecture visuals), but keep them high-level

Things to notice:

- This section can be brief, sometimes only a sentence or two.
- Consider separate engineering blog posts for highly technical details.

### Results

Showcase the tangible benefits your product provided. Back up your claims with specific, measurable outcomes.

Example elements:

- Metrics such as time saved, costs reduced, revenue increased, or headcount optimised
- Make key metrics **bold** for emphasis
- One or two sentences connecting the results to your product's features or offerings
- Customer quotes that emphasise the value they gained

Things to notice:

- A common practice is placing this section at the beginning of the case study for grabbing attention.
- If the customer does not know how to provide metrics, give them specific examples like this: "Deployment time reduced from **48 hours to 30 minutes**, resulting in a **90% increase** in release frequency.” Try to calculate the numbers yourself first and then ask for their permission to use the metrics.
- Some customers are reluctant to give you any numbers. My suggestion is you should prioritise writing case studies for those who can provide concrete metrics for maximum impact.

### Looking forward

Highlight the ongoing partnership between your company and the customer. Mention future opportunities or growth potential.

Example elements:

- Long-term benefits the customer anticipates
- Expansion of usage within the customer’s organisation
- Upcoming projects or collaborations
- A quote expressing satisfaction and enthusiasm for the partnership

## Using quotes wisely

Customer quotes add authenticity and human interest to your story. Use them strategically throughout the case study.

Tips for using quotes:

- Attribute each quote with the speaker's name and position
- Choose quotes that emphasise key points and decisions
- Include diverse perspectives from stakeholders, such as CEOs, Engineering Leaders, Product Managers, and Engineers
- Ensure the quotes align with the speaker’s role. For example, a C-level executive usually don’t talk about technical details
- When two quotes overlap, choose the one from a higher-ranking individual for greater impact

Never use any quotes that have not been explicitly approved by the customer.

This structure serves as a foundation for telling your customer’s story. Adapt the sections as needed to suit your focus and flow.
