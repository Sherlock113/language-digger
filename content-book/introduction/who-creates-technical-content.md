Technically, anyone who understands the subject matter can produce technical content. However, there is a specific role dedicated to this task â€” the technical writer. They are professionals who specialise in producing clear and concise information that helps users understand how to use the product.

The traditional role of a technical writer is mainly focused on documentation, but it has also evolved to cover many other types of content, such as blog posts and case studies. Essentially, a technical writer is an **information communicator** who:

- Bridges the gap between development teams and end users
- Researches and understands product functionality
- Experiences the product from a user's perspective
- Structures information for optimal understanding
- Creates content across various media formats

## Job titles in the field

Depending on the specific needs, the role of technical content creation appears under various titles:

- Technical Writers
- Technical Communicators
- Documentation Engineers
- Information Developers/Designers/Architects
- User Assistance Developers
- Content Strategists
- Knowledge Management Specialists

While the job titles may differ, the core responsibilities remain similar: producing clear, accurate, and user-friendly content to help users understand and use software effectively.

For simplicity, I will use the term "technical writer" throughout this book and will only introduce other specific terms when the content is particular to that role.

If you're entering the field, it's important not to get caught up in the job title. Instead, focus on the core responsibilities outlined in the job description.
