Newsletters are a powerful tool for keeping your audience engaged and informed. For a technical product, consider sending newsletters to:

- Share regular product updates and releases
- Summarize monthly updates: blog posts, case studies, documentation, etc.
- Announce activities and events, such as online webinars

### Rule of thumb

To achieve better open rates and engagement, keep these simple practices in mind:

1. **Never send the newsletter on the last day of a month.** People are focused on wrapping up tasks and their inboxes are flooded with promotional messages, subscription reminders, and invoices.
2. **Never send your newsletter on Monday**. Mondays are often overwhelming as people catch up on emails from the weekend. Your newsletter can easily get buried.
3. **Donâ€™t use more than one emoji in your subject line**. While a single emoji can be a fun and engaging touch, too many can make your newsletter appear unprofessional. In some cases, email services might flag it as spam, meaning your recipient may never even see it.
